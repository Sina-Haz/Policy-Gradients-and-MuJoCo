Some hyper params to play with:
 - gamma (can reduce variance of our estimated policy gradient)
 - number of trajectories to collect per iteration
 - batch gradient descent (sample from trajectory) vs stochastic (one transition) vs whole trajectory
 - collision penalty (part of the reward function)
 - maybe train value function for a few iterations before training value + policy
